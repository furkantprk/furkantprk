## Hello!

I'm **Ahmet Furkan Toprak**, a third-year Computer Engineering student at BalÄ±kesir University.  
Iâ€™m particularly interested in **Data Analysis**, **Database Systems**, **Machine Learning**, and **Artificial Intelligence**.  
Iâ€™m continuously working to improve myself in these areas and eager to learn new things.

During my second year, I completed an internship where I worked with **Flutter** and developed several projects.  
I'm open to all kinds of internship and work opportunities.
